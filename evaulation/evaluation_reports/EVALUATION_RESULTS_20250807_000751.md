| How much does the AlzaPlus membership cost and what is the return policy for members? | I do not have enough information to answer your question. The provided text does not mention the cost of an AlzaPlus membership or any specific return policy for members.                                                                                                                                | AlzaPlus membership costs €9.99 per month. A key benefit is an extended return period of 60 days.                                                                                                                                     | Alza Return Process                                                                                                                                 |                       0   | The provided context discusses Alza's return and warranty policies but does not contain any information about AlzaPlus membership costs or specific return policies for members.                                               |                    1 | The answer correctly states that the information is not present in the provided context.

| Can I return opened headphones?                                                       | Yes, based on the provided information, you can return opened headphones. The "Electronics" special return category states that "Can be opened to check contents."                                                                                                                                        | Based on the general terms and conditions, you cannot withdraw from the contract for hygienic goods that have been removed from their sealed packaging.                                                                               | Alza Return Process                                                                                                                                 |                       1   | The context contains a specific section on 'Electronics' which directly addresses the possibility of opening electronic items for inspection, making it highly relevant to the question about returning opened headphones.     |                    1 | The answer accurately quotes and references the 'Electronics' section of the context, which states that electronics 'Can be opened to check contents.' This directly supports the claim made in the answer.           |                 0   | The ground truth states that hygienic goods with broken seals cannot be returned. While the context allows opened electronics, it does not specify if headphones fall under hygienic goods or if their packaging is considered a seal that cannot be broken. The answer assumes headphones can be returned opened without addressing potential exceptions like hygienic seals, which contradicts the general principle mentioned in the ground truth. |
